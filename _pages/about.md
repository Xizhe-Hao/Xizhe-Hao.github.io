I am a graduate student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Washington, advised by Prof. [Shwetak Patel](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~shwetak/). I am also fortunate to work with Prof. [Vikram Iyer](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~vsiyer/) and Prof. [Jon E. Froehlich](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/). My work at [UW Ubicomp Lab](https://ubicomplab.cs.washington.edu/) focuses on wearable devices and embedded systems.

Prior to the University of Washington, I earned my B.Eng. in Automation from [Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/) in Shenzhen, China, where I graduated with distinction.

My research interests lie in developing intelligent end-to-end systems that integrate seamlessly into everyday life, with an emphasis on Human-Computer Interaction, wearable computing, and embedded systems design. I am particularly interested in creating novel sensing techniques and interaction methods that enhance human capabilities.
