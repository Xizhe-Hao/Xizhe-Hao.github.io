## Beyond Research

### 🍳 Cooking

Cooking is like another language to me—a way to express feelings and show love to friends and family. I find fascinating parallels between cooking and research: both require finding the right "recipe," carefully selecting and preparing materials, experimenting to discover the optimal approach, and understanding that every detail matters—even the smallest seasoning can make a difference. Time management is crucial in both, whether you're coordinating multiple dishes or juggling research experiments.

### ⛰️ Hiking

I love exploring trails and enjoying the outdoors. There's something refreshing about disconnecting from technology and connecting with nature.

### 🏸 Badminton

A great way to stay active and enjoy friendly competition with friends.

Strategic thinking meets psychology—poker is the perfect blend of math, probability, and reading people.
