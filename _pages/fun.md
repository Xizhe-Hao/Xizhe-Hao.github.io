## Beyond Research

### 🍳 Cooking

Cooking is like another language to me—a way to express emotions and show love to friends and family.

I also find fascinating parallels between cooking and research. Both involve discovering the right “recipe,” carefully selecting and preparing materials, and experimenting to find the optimal approach. In both, attention to detail is essential—even the smallest seasoning or adjustment can make a significant difference. Time management is equally crucial, whether coordinating multiple dishes in the kitchen or juggling experiments in the lab.

### ⛰️ Hiking

I really love exploring trails and enjoying the outdoors. There's something refreshing about disconnecting from technology and connecting with nature.

### 🏸 Badminton

A great way to stay active and enjoy friendly competition with friends.

Poker perfectly blends strategic thinking, psychology, math, and probability. It's also a great way to understand myself and human nature better.
