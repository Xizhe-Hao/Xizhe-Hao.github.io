## Thrilled to Begin My Graduate Life at UW ðŸŽ‰
I am incredibly excited to start my graduate studies at the University of Washington. This new chapter brings with it a wealth of opportunities to dive deeper into my interests in embedded systems, AIoT, and machine learning, while also exploring how technology and entrepreneurship can address societal challenges.

From the supportive faculty to the diverse and inspiring student community, UW has already begun to feel like home. I look forward to expanding my knowledge, building meaningful connections, and tackling new challenges in this vibrant academic environment.

Thank you to everyone who has made this transition so smooth and welcomingâ€”Iâ€™m ready to make the most of my time here!
