## Project Overview
Global freshwater scarcity is a pressing challenge for sustainable development, with agriculture consuming over 70% of the world's freshwater resourcesâ€”much of which is wasted due to inefficient irrigation methods. In parallel, modern lifestyles have increased the demand for remote plant care solutions. To address these challenges, I developed an **intelligent, fully automatic flowerpot system** that integrates cutting-edge technologies such as micropumps, intelligent sensors, IoT cloud platforms, and AI-powered large language models. This system ensures precise control of plant care, providing the ideal environment for growth while significantly reducing water waste.


### Why We Do This Project:
- **Tackle Global Water Scarcity**: Freshwater demand continues to rise, especially in agriculture, which is the largest consumer. This project aims to create a water-efficient solution to reduce waste and optimize resource use. 
- **Enhance Agricultural Sustainability**: Traditional irrigation methods are often wasteful and lack precision. By enabling accurate, need-based water and nutrient control, this project promotes more sustainable farming practices.  
- **Accommodate Busy Lifestyles**: With increasingly hectic schedules and frequent travel, people often find it difficult to care for plants consistently. This automated planter ensures reliable plant maintenance even when users are unavailable.  
- **Support Plant Enthusiasts and Beginners**: Caring for plants, particularly exotic or sensitive species, can be challenging for inexperienced growers. The system provides smart recommendations and automation to simplify plant care.  
- **Drive Technological Advancement**: By combining AI, IoT, and sensor technologies, this project demonstrates how cutting-edge innovations can address practical challenges and contribute to the development of smart agriculture.

</figure>
The hardware framework is centered on a **Raspberry Pi**, which acts as the control hub. It is equipped with various sensors and modules to facilitate data collection and actuation:

- **Environmental Monitoring**: Sensors measure humidity, soil moisture, temperature, and light intensity in real-time.
- **Irrigation Control**: A peristaltic pump, managed by a relay module, provides precise water delivery to plants.
- **Fertilization Mechanism**: A micropump communicates with the software to regulate fertilizer application accurately.
- **High-Definition Camera**: Captures real-time images of plants for visual monitoring and AI analysis.

The hardware design ensures precise gardening automation by collecting environmental data and implementing corresponding actions through controlled actuation.

## 5. Web Page

The **web interface** is designed for intuitive interaction, displaying real-time plant data and care insights. It is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** and features the following core functionalities:

### 5.1 Webpage Structure and Features

The interface is divided into four sections:

1. **Environmental Data**: Displays real-time measurements of humidity, soil moisture, temperature, and light intensity, each with corresponding timestamps.
2. **Plant Image**: Shows a high-definition image of the plant, converted from Base64 to JPEG format, with a timestamp for capture time.
3. **Suggestions**: Provides actionable plant care advice based on real-time analysis, including recommendations for watering, light exposure, and temperature adjustments.
4. **Watering and Fertilizing Needs**: Displays the plant's current requirements on a scale, helping users make informed decisions.

### 5.2 Data Handling Workflow

1. **Backend Integration**: Data from the IoT platform is processed using a **Flask** backend, which:
   - Verifies the device's credentials (device name, product name, product password).
   - Fetches and formats the sensor data.
   - Converts timestamps from milliseconds to human-readable 24-hour format.
   - Prepares the data for frontend presentation.

2. **Dynamic Updates**: Using JavaScript, the frontend dynamically updates the interface by:
   - Mapping the backend's data to HTML elements.
   - Rendering Base64-encoded images into readable formats for user convenience.
