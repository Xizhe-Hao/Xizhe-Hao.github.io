## Project Overview
Global freshwater scarcity is a pressing challenge for sustainable development, with agriculture consuming over 70% of the world's freshwater resourcesâ€”much of which is wasted due to inefficient irrigation methods. In parallel, modern lifestyles have increased the demand for remote plant care solutions. To address these challenges, I developed an **intelligent, fully automatic flowerpot system** that integrates cutting-edge technologies such as micropumps, intelligent sensors, IoT cloud platforms, and AI-powered large language models. This system ensures precise control of plant care, providing the ideal environment for growth while significantly reducing water waste.


### Why We Do This Project:
- **Tackle Global Water Scarcity**: Freshwater demand continues to rise, especially in agriculture, which is the largest consumer. This project aims to create a water-efficient solution to reduce waste and optimize resource use. 
- **Enhance Agricultural Sustainability**: Traditional irrigation methods are often wasteful and lack precision. By enabling accurate, need-based water and nutrient control, this project promotes more sustainable farming practices.  
- **Accommodate Busy Lifestyles**: With increasingly hectic schedules and frequent travel, people often find it difficult to care for plants consistently. This automated planter ensures reliable plant maintenance even when users are unavailable.  
- **Support Plant Enthusiasts and Beginners**: Caring for plants, particularly exotic or sensitive species, can be challenging for inexperienced growers. The system provides smart recommendations and automation to simplify plant care.  
- **Drive Technological Advancement**: By combining AI, IoT, and sensor technologies, this project demonstrates how cutting-edge innovations can address practical challenges and contribute to the development of smart agriculture.  


## 1. System Architecture

The architecture illustrates the system's modular design, highlighting the key components:
- **Monitoring System**: Tracks air temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light intensity using advanced sensors and a Pi-Camera for real-time imaging.
- **Display System**: Uses the Alibaba Cloud IoT platform for data processing and real-time display on a web-based dashboard.
- **Irrigation System**: Incorporates a peristaltic pump and a micropump to deliver precise watering and fertilization.
- **Intelligent System**: Leverages ChatGPT for detecting pests, analyzing plant health, and providing actionable insights for maintenance.

## 2. Hardware Components

In terms of hardware, the system uses a Raspberry Pi central control unit, equipped with various environmental monitoring sensors and a high-definition camera to monitor plant growth in real-time. The irrigation module uses a peristaltic pump and relay to precisely control watering, while fertilizer application is finely regulated by the micropump through software and hardware communication, demonstrating precise control in gardening automation.
