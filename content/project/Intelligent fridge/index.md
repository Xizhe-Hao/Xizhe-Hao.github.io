## Project Overview
The Smart Refrigerator leverages **AIoT (Artificial Intelligence of Things)** principles to monitor and manage refrigerator contents. With this system, users can track food freshness, receive warnings on expired items, and access recommendations for food usage based on fridge contents.

### Why We Do This Project:
In todayâ€™s fast-paced world, food waste has become a growing concern, and many households struggle with managing food storage effectively. Our project aims to address these challenges by:
- **Reducing Food Waste**: Proactively tracking expiration dates and providing timely alerts to prevent spoilage.  
- **Promoting Sustainability**: Optimizing food usage with AI-powered recipe suggestions, encouraging users to consume available ingredients efficiently.  
- **Enhancing User Convenience**: Automating inventory management to save time and effort, making food management smarter and simpler.

With these goals, the Smart Refrigerator delivers a blend of convenience, sustainability, and innovation, ensuring smarter food management for households and businesses alike.

## 2. Hardware Components

The hardware setup is designed to ensure seamless integration and functionality:
- Sensors collect environmental and food-related data.
- Data is transmitted to the Raspberry Pi through ESP32 and Micro:bit modules.
- The Raspberry Pi acts as the central processing hub, analyzing data and interfacing with the AI and web-based components.

### Key Sensors and Modules:
1. **Environmental Sensors**:
   - **DHT11**: Measures temperature and humidity to ensure optimal storage conditions for food items.
   - **HC-SR04**: Ultrasonic sensor for detecting door status and measuring distances.
   - **Passive Buzzer and RGB LED**: Provide visual and auditory alerts for warnings, such as when the refrigerator door remains open.
   - **Weight Sensor (HX711)**: Collects weight data of stored food items with precision, enabling effective inventory management.  


2. **Image Capture and Processing**:
   - **Pi Camera**: Captures images of food items for further processing and classification using AI models.

3. **Communication Modules**:
   - **ESP32**: Gathers sensor data (temperature, humidity, door status) and transmits it to the Raspberry Pi via MQTT protocol for real-time monitoring and warnings.
   - **Micro:bit Modules**: Enable **serial** and **radio communication** for capturing, weighing, and managing inventory.

## 3. Artificial Intelligence Integration

The Smart Refrigerator uses a **Pre-trained YOLOv8 model** to assess food expiration and predict freshness. The Raspberry Piâ€™s AI capabilities enable real-time predictions with high accuracy, evaluated through: 
- **Confusion Matrix** and **F1-Confidence Curve** to track prediction performance.

</figure>


### AI Model Workflow
The AI integration follows a step-by-step roadmap to achieve accurate and real-time predictions:

1. **Step 0: Pre-trained AI Model on PC**  
   A YOLOv8 model is pre-trained on a labeled dataset of various food categories to detect and classify food items accurately.

2. **Step 1: Pi Camera Capture**  
   The Raspberry Pi utilizes the Pi Camera to capture real-time images of food items stored in the refrigerator.

3. **Step 2: AI Predictions on Raspberry Pi**  
   YOLOv8 is deployed on the Raspberry Pi for on-device inference. It detects food items, classifies them into predefined categories, and predicts the freshness.

4. **Step 3: Weight Information Collector**  
   The system correlates weight data collected via the HX711 sensor with the visual classification to ensure precise inventory management.

5. **Step 4: Update Data on Web Database**  
   The classified food data and weight measurements are stored in a cloud-based web database for further analysis and user access.

### Valid Predictions
The YOLOv8 model effectively detects and classifies food items in real-time. The **validation predictions** show:
- Successful identification of common food items like apples, bananas, carrots, and fish with high confidence levels.
- Bounding boxes accurately localize each item in the images, enabling precise tracking.

## 4. Web Interface and Database Management

The system features a **web-based interface** that allows users to interact with the Smart Refrigerator's data.

### Features of the Web Interface

1. **Dynamic Dashboard**:
   - Displays real-time data on:
     - Environmental conditions (temperature, humidity).
     - Fridge door status (open/closed).
     - Alerts for expiring or expired food items.
